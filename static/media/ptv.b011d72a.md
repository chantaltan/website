# Background 

Roughly 70,000–90,000 individuals seek asylum [every year](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Refugees_Asylees_2017.pdf). These asylum seekers range from individuals wanting to find a better life, avoiding political prosecution, or escaping torture and persecution for their beliefs. Many of these asylum seekers arrive to the United States with nothing else besides what they can carry in their suitcases and have no connections to resources when they first arrive.

# Solution 

[Program for Torture Victims (PTV)](https://ptvla.org/) aims to rebuild the lives of survivors of torture and persecution from over 70 countries. PTV does this by connecting survivors to resources and rehabilitation to help restore their health and dignity. To better serve and increase awareness of available resources for PTV’s service recipients, our project will develop a mobile application that will direct survivors to resources specific to their needs and provide an online community.
