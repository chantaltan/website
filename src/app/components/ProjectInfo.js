          asylum seekers range from individuals wanting to find a better life, avoiding political prosecution, or
          escaping torture and persecution for their beliefs. Many of these asylum seekers arrive to the United States
          with nothing else besides what they can carry in their suitcases and have no connections to resources when they
          first arrive.

          Program for Torture Victims (PTV) aims to rebuild the lives of survivors of torture and persecution from over 70
          countries. PTV does this by connecting survivors to resources and rehabilitation to help restore their health and
          dignity. To better serve and increase awareness of available resources for PTVâ€™s service recipients, our project
          will develop a mobile application that will direct survivors to resources specific to their needs and provide an
          online community.

          Harmony Project uses music education as an avenue to inspire 3,500 underserved children to graduate high school,
          attain higher education, and pursue their career aspirations. Harmony Project accomplishes this by pairing children
          with an instructor who teaches them how to play a musical instrument. Our project will create a platform that will
          serve as the primary means for communicating with students and parents as well as collecting enrollment documents,
          surveys, and evaluation data from instructors and for students to submit assignments and receive feedback. The
          project will greatly reduce the burden of reviewing and organizing documents by hand and increase efficiency by
          moving and centralizing information to an online platform accessible by the nonprofit staff, children, and parents.
