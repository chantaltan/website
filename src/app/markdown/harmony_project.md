# Background 

From 2015â€“2017, Los Angeles County had the [highest amount of children living under poverty level in California](https://www.ppic.org/publication/poverty-in-california/). 12.2% of children who come from impoverished communities in the Los Angeles County do not graduate high school and are dissuaded to pursue their career aspirations due to their [socioeconomic status](http://laschoolreport.com/californias-graduation-rate-rises-but-theres-no-improvement-in-getting-students-eligible-for-state-universities/).

# Solution 
[Harmony Project](https://www.harmony-project.org/) uses music education as an avenue to inspire 3,500 underserved children to graduate high school, attain higher education, and pursue their career aspirations. Harmony Project accomplishes this by pairing children with an instructor who teaches them how to play a musical instrument. Our project will create a platform that will serve as the primary means for communicating with students and parents as well as collecting enrollment documents, surveys, and evaluation data from instructors and for students to submit assignments and receive feedback. The project will greatly reduce the burden of reviewing and organizing documents by hand and increase efficiency by moving and centralizing information to an online platform accessible by the nonprofit staff, children, and parents.
